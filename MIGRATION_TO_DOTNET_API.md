# Migration to .NET API - Summary

> **⚠️ DATABASE MIGRATION REQUIRED**: See `database-migration.sql` for required schema changes
> **📋 API IMPROVEMENTS**: See `API-IMPROVEMENTS.md` for detailed endpoint specifications

## ✅ Completed Changes

### 1. **Authentication System**
- Removed Supabase `AuthContext` and replaced with `DotNetAuthContext`
- Updated all pages to use `useDotNetAuth()` hook instead of `useAuth()`
- Login now redirects to `/dotnet-login` (with OTP 2-step authentication support)
- Registration available at `/dotnet-register`
- OTP verification at `/otp-verify`

### 2. **Updated Components**
- **DashboardLayout**: Now uses .NET API authentication
- **Dashboard**: Fetches contact statistics from Contact Us API
- **ContactsManager**: Uses Contact Us API for basic CRUD operations

### 3. **Removed Dependencies**
- No longer using Supabase client for authentication
- No longer using Supabase for data fetching in updated pages

## ⚠️ Features That Need .NET API Endpoints

The following features are currently **limited or disabled** because they require new endpoints in your .NET API:

### 1. **Role Management System** (High Priority)
**Current State**: Temporarily disabled role checks
**What's Needed**:
```csharp
// Endpoints needed:
GET /users/me/roles              // Get current user's roles
GET /users/{userId}/roles        // Get specific user's roles
POST /users/{userId}/roles       // Assign role to user
DELETE /users/{userId}/roles/{roleId} // Remove role from user
GET /roles                       // List all available roles
```

**Impact**: 
- Role-based access control is currently hardcoded
- Cannot manage user permissions
- Super admin features are disabled

---

### 2. **Conversation/Messaging System** (High Priority)
**Current State**: Only shows initial contact message
**What's Needed**:
```csharp
// Endpoints needed:
GET /contact-us/{id}/messages    // Get all messages for a contact
POST /contact-us/{id}/messages   // Send reply to contact
PUT /messages/{id}               // Mark message as read
```

**Impact**:
- Cannot reply to contacts within the app
- No conversation history
- Admin cannot track back-and-forth communication

---

### 3. **Enhanced Status Management** (Medium Priority)
**Current State**: Simple resolved/unresolved toggle
**What's Needed**:
```csharp
// Enhanced UpdateContactMessageCommand:
public class UpdateContactMessageCommand {
    public string Status { get; set; } // new, in_progress, on_hold, resolved, closed
    public string StatusComment { get; set; } // Required for certain status changes
    public DateTime? ResolvedAt { get; set; }
    public string ResolvedBy { get; set; } // User ID who resolved
}

// Endpoints needed:
GET /contact-us/{id}/status-history  // Get status change history
```

**Impact**:
- Limited status tracking (only resolved/unresolved)
- No audit trail for status changes
- Cannot add notes when changing status

---

### 4. **Profile Management** (Medium Priority)
**Current State**: Page not migrated yet (still uses Supabase)
**What's Needed**:
```csharp
// Endpoints needed:
GET /users/me                    // Get current user profile
PUT /users/me                    // Update current user profile
POST /users/me/avatar            // Upload avatar image
PUT /users/change-password       // Already exists ✓
```

**Impact**:
- ProfileSettings page still uses Supabase
- Cannot update user information
- Avatar upload not available

---

### 5. **User Management** (Low Priority)
**Current State**: Page not migrated yet (still uses Supabase)
**What's Needed**:
```csharp
// Endpoints needed:
GET /users                       // List all users with pagination
GET /users/{id}                  // Already exists ✓
PUT /users/{id}/status           // Enable/disable user accounts
GET /users/{id}/activity         // Get user activity logs
```

**Impact**:
- UsersList page still uses Supabase
- Cannot view all registered users
- No user management capabilities

---

### 6. **Advanced Filtering & Search** (Low Priority)
**What's Needed**:
```csharp
// Enhanced query parameters:
GET /contact-us?
    status=resolved|unresolved&
    dateFrom=2024-01-01&
    dateTo=2024-12-31&
    search=keyword&
    page=1&
    pageSize=20&
    sortBy=createdAt&
    sortOrder=desc
```

**Impact**:
- Limited filtering options
- No pagination
- No advanced search

---

## 🔧 How to Test Current Implementation

1. **Set Environment Variable**:
   ```bash
   # Add to .env file:
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://localhost:5001
   ```

2. **Start Your .NET API**:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

3. **Test Login Flow**:
   - Go to `/dotnet-login`
   - Choose password or OTP login
   - For OTP: Enter email/phone → Verify code at `/otp-verify`

4. **Test Contact Management**:
   - Go to `/contacts`
   - View contact list
   - Click a contact to see details
   - Toggle resolved/unresolved status
   - Delete contacts

5. **Test Dashboard**:
   - Go to `/dashboard`
   - View statistics and charts based on Contact Us data

## 📋 Recommended Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Core Features (Do First)
1. ✅ User authentication (Already done)
2. 🔴 Role management endpoints
3. 🔴 Current user profile endpoint (`GET /users/me`)

### Phase 2: Contact Management
4. 🔴 Message/conversation endpoints
5. 🔴 Enhanced status management with history
6. 🔴 Notification system (email/SMS for replies)

### Phase 3: Admin Features
7. 🔴 User list with pagination
8. 🔴 Profile update endpoints
9. 🔴 Advanced filtering and search

### Phase 4: Polish
10. 🟡 Activity logging
11. 🟡 File attachments for contacts
12. 🟡 Bulk operations

## 🚨 Security Considerations

When implementing new endpoints, ensure:

1. **Authentication**: All endpoints require valid JWT token
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control
   - Regular users: Can only access their own data
   - Admins: Can manage contacts
   - Super Admins: Can manage users and roles

3. **Validation**: Input validation using FluentValidation
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse
5. **CORS**: Configure properly for your frontend domain

## 📞 Need Help?

If you need assistance implementing any of these endpoints, refer to:
- Your existing User endpoints for authentication patterns
- Contact Us endpoints for CRUD patterns
- Products endpoints for simple API examples

The patterns are already established in your codebase - just extend them for new features!
